### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

for over 10 years I'm working in eCommerce business with serveral positions started as developer, over project manager, leading the development department of a well known eCommerce platform and now working for [Makaira](https://makaira.io) as product manager.

I'm always interested in getting things done in a pragmatic way and to push forward with using great technologie. I personally like to mangage the bridge between the development and the business.
